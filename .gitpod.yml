##
## This '.gitpod.yml' file when placed at the root of a project instructs
## Gitpod how to prepare & build the project, start development environments
## and configure continuous prebuilds. Prebuilds when enabled builds a project
## like a CI server so you can start coding right away - no more waiting for
## dependencies to download and builds to finish when reviewing pull-requests
## or hacking on something new.
##
## With Gitpod you can develop software from any device (even iPads) via 
## desktop or browser based versions of VS Code or any JetBrains IDE and
## customise it to your individual needs - from themes to extensions, you
## have full control.
##
## The easiest way to try out Gitpod is install the browser extenion:
## 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension' or by prefixing
## 'https://gitpod.io#' to the source control URL of any project.
##
## For example: 'https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod'


## The 'tasks' section defines how Gitpod prepares & builds this project
## and how it can start development servers. With Gitpod, there are three
## types of tasks:
##
## - before: Use this for tasks that need to run before init and before command. 
## - init: Use this to configure prebuilds of heavy-lifting tasks such as
##         downloading dependencies or compiling source code.
## - command: Use this to start your database or application when the workspace starts.
##
## Learn more about these tasks at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-start-tasks'

tasks:
  - name: App
    init: npm install
    command: npm run start
    openMode: split-left

 
## The 'ports' section defines various ports your may listen on are 
## configured in Gitpod on an authenticated URL. By default, all ports
## are in private visibility state.
##
## Learn more about ports at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-ports'

ports:
 - port: 3000 # alternatively configure entire ranges via '8080-8090'
   visibility: private # either 'public' or 'private' (default)
   onOpen: open-browser # either 'open-browser', 'open-preview' or 'ignore'

## The 'vscode' section defines a list of Visual Studio Code extensions from
## the OpenVSX.org registry to be installed upon workspace startup. OpenVSX
## is an open alternative to the proprietary Visual Studio Code Marketplace
## and extensions can be added by sending a pull-request with the extension
## identifier to https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions
##
## The identifier of an extension is always ${publisher}.${name}.
##
## For example: 'vscodevim.vim'
